# ⚡ Power Bill Database System – Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard project designed to manage, analyze, and visualize electricity billing data. This project simulates a real-world utility billing system to extract key insights from payment and consumption patterns across different time periods and regions.

 ✨ Features

- Interactive dashboard with dynamic filtering by billing month
- KPI card displaying total on-time revenue and goal tracking
- Visual comparison of payments by year
- Monthly trend analysis of revenue, units consumed, and payment behavior
- Consumption vs billing relationship graph
- City-wise geographical billing activity
- Meter-wise table of paid and unpaid amounts
-Used SQL queries to solve business problems

🛠 Tools Used

- Power BI – for building interactive visual dashboards  
- Excel/CSV – as the primary dataset format  
- SQL – for writing queries to analyze revenue, payment status, and usage
